# Stats220

## Repo for STATS 220. 

A little about **me**:

* I am undertaking a degree in Mathematics
* I am taking STATS 220 because I want to improve my skills in:
  1. Statistics
  2. Coding 
* I am interested in learning about application of code in modern websites and the larger workplaces of the latest tech.
