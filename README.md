# Stats220

## Repo for STATS 220. 

A little about **me**:

* I am undertaking a degree in Mathematics 
* I am taking STATS 220 because I want to improve my skills in:
  1. Statistics
  2. Coding 
* I am interested in learning about the *application* of code in the internet and workplaces of the latest tech.

A meme that captures how I currently feel about my university studies is ![]([https://media2.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExdGtndjcweTE2bTJscWowZzdvbHFubmdtcmhvN2w0aWYyZHdwamw3YSZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/Rlwz4m0aHgXH13jyrE/giphy.gif])
