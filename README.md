# stats220

This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in Mathematics
- I am taking STATS 220 because I want to improve my Statistics and Coding skills.
- I am interested in learning about application of code in modern websites and the larger workplaces of the latest tech.
